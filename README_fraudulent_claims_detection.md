# 🧾 Fraudulent Claims Detection

This project applies exploratory data analysis and anomaly detection techniques to identify potentially fraudulent insurance claims. It demonstrates foundational data analytics skills using Python, Pandas, and real-world-like datasets.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw insurance claims data
- Explore data relationships and identify suspicious patterns
- Engineer new features to help distinguish fraud vs. non-fraud
- Visualize insights using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
- Deliver reproducible analysis via Jupyter Notebooks
